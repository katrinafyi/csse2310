# csse2310

These are the 3 programming assignments I wrote for UQ's CSSE2310, in semester 2 of 2019. 

Briefly, these were the projects:
- **Assignment 1**: console-based board game, with save/load from file and support for automatic players.
- **Assignment 2**: debugging exercises using the gdb debugger and "printf debugging", not available here.
- **Assignment 3**: multiplayer card game, using multiple processes and communication via pipes.
- **Assignment 4**: supply depot application, interacting with other depots through messages over TCP.

Some code solutions for past exam questions are also available.
